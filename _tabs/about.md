Hi, I am Newton Ashiundu, and this is What I Bring to the Table as a Pentester and UX/UI designer.
Pentesting & Ethical Hacking:
OWASP Top 10 audits, 
custom exploit development, and compliance (SOC 2, GDPR).
I've uncovered zero-days that saved clients millions.
UX/UI Design:
Intuitive interfaces with accessibility at heart—think dark mode toggles that hide more than just your eyes.
Tools: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch.
